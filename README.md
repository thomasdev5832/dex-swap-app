## Project Overview

The DEX project is focused on creating a decentralized exchange where users can securely and trustlessly exchange digital assets without the need for intermediaries. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, the DEX enables peer-to-peer trading while ensuring transparency, security, and censorship resistance.

## Features

- **Decentralization**: Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, a DEX operates without a central authority, allowing users to trade directly with each other peer-to-peer.

- **Security**: DEX platforms typically prioritize security by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts to facilitate secure transactions and custody of assets. Users have control over their private keys, reducing the risk of hacking or unauthorized access.

- **Non-Custodial** Trading: DEXs allow users to retain control of their funds throughout the trading process. Instead of depositing funds into a centralized exchange wallet, users connect their wallets directly to the DEX platform, enabling trustless transactions without the need for intermediaries.

- **Transparency**: Transactions on a DEX are recorded on a public blockchain, providing transparent and immutable records of all trades. This transparency helps build trust among users and ensures fair trading practices.

- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Some advanced DEXs support cross-chain trading, enabling users to exchange assets across different blockchain networks without relying on centralized intermediaries.

- **Interoperability**: DEXs may integrate with other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and applications, enabling interoperability between different decentralized platforms and enhancing the overall DeFi ecosystem.

- **Low Fees**: Due to the absence of intermediaries, DEXs typically have lower trading fees compared to centralized exchanges. This can lead to cost savings for traders, especially for frequent or high-volume traders.
